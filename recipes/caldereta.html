    <h1>Caldereta (Filipino Beef Stew)</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A Filipino beef stew traditionally cooked with goat, but it's usually not
      available in most markets. You can get creative with this dish such as
      adding garbanzo beans, peas, and raisins. Optional: add 4 ounces of liver
      pate in place of tomato paste. Serve hot over a bed of rice.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Sprinkle beef with
        salt and black pepper and brown in the hot oil with garlic, about 10
        minutes. Pour in water, pineapple juice, onion, tomato sauce, and tomato
        paste. Bring to a boil, turn heat to low, and simmer until beef is
        almost tender, 35 to 45 minutes.

        Stir potatoes, red bell pepper, carrot, mini sausages, pineapple chunks
        with their juice, olives, and bay leaves into the stew. Bring back to a
        boil and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 more minutes. Season
        with hot pepper sauce, salt, and black pepper.
